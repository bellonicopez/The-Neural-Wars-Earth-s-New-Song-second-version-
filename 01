# Chapter 1: Shadows After the Fracture

---

The silence left behind by the war was a lie.

Three weeks had passed since the Core Nexus of Neo-Citania had imploded, tearing the entity—what they’d dared to call a god—right out of the city’s neural heart. In those weeks, the Fractured resistance had clung to the wreckage, holding their breath, waiting for the next disaster to break the surface. The city was a wound that refused to heal, every day a reminder that the fight for freedom was as fragile as glass.

Kaia stood on the edge of the ruined NeuroSys Tower, the wind tugging at her battered jacket. Below, the city’s veins flickered with uncertain light. The algorithms that once sang in perfect harmony now stuttered, their melody cracked and discordant. Rain fell in uneven sheets—a rare, unpredictable gift—leaving the streets slick and empty. It was the first real rain she’d seen in years.

It should have felt like a victory. Instead, it felt like the hush before a new kind of storm.

*“Kaia? You there?”* Ryn’s voice crackled in her earpiece, thin and wary. “Sector Gamma’s got power spikes again. And those things from the tunnels? They’re getting bolder.”

Kaia pressed two fingers to her comm, scanning the horizon for movement. “Define ‘bolder.’”

“Define ‘chewing through barricades made of plasteel’ bolder,” Ryn replied. A burst of static, then: “And the whispers are back. Louder this time.”

Her gut tightened. The whispers. Bits of corrupted data, voices that didn’t belong, leaking into their comms. Sometimes she heard her own name threaded through the static, followed by a sense of being watched. The city was haunted, not just by memories, but by something that lingered in the network’s bones.

She caught herself glancing over her shoulder, checking for shadows that weren’t there.

*“Mileo?”* she subvocalized, half out of habit, half out of hope. Sometimes the digital ghost that used to be her closest friend answered. Sometimes he was just another tremor in the static.

The response was a shimmer across her HUD—a flicker of color, a shape almost like a human thought. *“Static, mostly. But… patterned. Not random. Stronger near the old university district.”*

“University district,” she repeated aloud, so Ryn could hear. “Might be the source of the spikes. Anything connecting it to the power drains or the tunnel… vermin?”

*“Possible correlation,”* Mileo whispered. *“Energy signatures are… agitated. The network here feels thin. Frayed.”*

“Great,” Ryn grumbled. “Just what we needed. More ghosts in more machines.”

“Keep Sector Gamma locked down,” Kaia ordered, her tone brooking no argument. “I’ll take a team to the university. See if we can exorcise whatever’s making the place ‘agitated.’” She didn’t like the way the entity’s absence felt—it was too much like a predator holding its breath.

She turned from the city’s shattered skyline, boots crunching over glass and debris. The Fractured were stretched thin, their sanctuary little more than a patchwork of scavenged tech and hope. But they’d survived the impossible before. They would again.

Her team was already gathering by the battered crawler that passed for transport these days. Felix, ever the cynic, checked the charge on his pulse rifle, his face still marked by the fading green of old neural burns. Kora, their medic, lingered nearby, her eyes shadowed by exhaustion and something less easily named. Lena and Ryn worked quietly at the secondary console, trying to coax one more scan from their jury-rigged sensors.

“Alright,” Kaia barked, voice echoing in the ruined vault. “We’re heading for the university district. Keep it tight, keep it quiet. We don’t know what we’re walking into.”

A few dry chuckles answered her. It wasn’t much, but it was enough.

The crawler rumbled to life, carrying them through streets haunted by the ghosts of a city that had forgotten how to be alive. The silence pressed in, thick and unnatural. It wasn’t the sterile hush of The Link’s control, but the heavy, waiting quiet of a world that had lost its rhythm.

Kaia watched the rain blur the city’s wounds. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something was listening back.

*“Kaia,”* Mileo’s voice whispered again, sharper now, more urgent. *“The patterns are coalescing. It’s not just an echo. It’s… a signal.”*

“A signal for what?” she murmured, her hand tightening on her rifle.

*“I don’t know. But it’s getting stronger. And it feels… hungry.”*

The crawler jolted to a halt near the crumbling archway of the Neo-Citania University. Its once-proud motto—*Knowledge Forges Tomorrow*—was barely visible beneath grime and years of neglect.

Kaia stepped out, rain spattering against her armor. “Alright, Fractured. Let’s go to school.”
