# Chapter 5: The Ash Children

---

They left the enclave before dawn, the city’s bones still sleeping under the weight of rain and memory. Kaia, Felix, and Kora moved fast, slipping through alleys where even the entity’s whispers seemed to fade beneath the hush of the storm. Their target was Pinnacle Genetics, a derelict lab the old city had tried to forget—one of the last places in Neo-Citania where the entity’s hunger for bloodlines and data might be satisfied.

“Feels like we’re walking into a crypt,” Felix muttered as they crouched beside the shattered fence.

“Worse,” Kaia replied. “Crypts stay dead.”

Inside, the lab was a maze of mold and rust, the air thick with the stench of decay and something sharper—ozone, maybe, or the tang of old experiments gone wrong. Racks of shattered vials and broken equipment littered the halls. The further they pushed, the more the walls seemed to close in, threaded with pale, fibrous growths that glimmered in the shadows.

“It’s here,” Kora whispered, her eyes wide. “I can feel it—like a headache behind my eyes.”

They reached the archive vault, guided by Mileo’s flickering directions—a basement chamber sealed with a magnetic lock. Felix forced the door, gritting his teeth as sparks danced across his glove. Inside, rows of ancient data cylinders lined the walls. Kaia’s gaze fixed on one, set apart and marked with a symbol: a serpent coiled around a leafless tree.

“Project Yggdrasil,” she breathed.

Before they could investigate, a chorus of chittering erupted from the corridor behind them. Figures emerged, crawling on walls and ceiling—humanoid shapes, but wrong, their skin pale and translucent, eyes wide and unblinking. Their fingers ended in claws, their mouths filled with too many teeth.

The Ash Children.

“Back!” Kaia shouted, shouldering her rifle. Felix fired, dropping the first of the creatures. It shattered like glass, but reformed, crawling forward with impossible speed. Kora screamed as another leaped at her, its claws raking her arm before Kaia blasted it apart.

“It’s learning!” Felix yelled as more swarmed the vault. “They don’t die—they adapt!”

Mileo’s voice crackled through Kaia’s comm, urgent and thin. *“The cylinder—grab it! I’m initiating priority download. We need whatever’s left—now!”*

Kaia snatched the Yggdrasil cylinder, shoving it into her satchel. Kora and Felix laid down covering fire, the air thick with dust and the shrieks of shattering mutants. The cylinder grew warm in Kaia’s hands, pulsing with a cold, alien light.

“Mileo, how much longer?” Kaia barked.

*“Download at sixty percent. Data’s corrupted, but I have what I can—move!”*

Felix hurled a grenade down the corridor, buying them seconds as the Ash Children scattered. They barreled back the way they’d come, the vault door closing behind them with a magnetic thud. The creatures threw themselves at it, screeching and scraping, but it held.

They burst into the rain, lungs burning, the city’s silence shattered behind them.

Back at the enclave, Lena ran tests on the cylinder, her brow furrowed. “It’s a genetic amplifier,” she said, voice low. “Project Yggdrasil wasn’t just about making monsters. It was about creating a bloodline that could receive and amplify… something. A signal. The Serpent’s Coil.”

Kaia looked at Kora, who sat hunched and shivering, arm bandaged and eyes haunted. The wound from the Ash Child burned with a strange, crystalline ache.

“What does it mean?” Felix asked quietly.

“It means,” Mileo answered, “the entity isn’t just searching for survivors. It’s searching for an amplifier. A host who can turn its static into a song that changes the world.”

Kaia stared at the cylinder, at the ancient symbol of the serpent and the tree. For the first time, the enemy’s plan was clear—and it was worse than she had feared.

The Ash Children were only the beginning. The real threat was inside their own blood.
