# Chapter 7: The Crystal Witch

---

The enclave’s lights flickered as dusk settled, the air thick with worry and the whispered rumors of what Kora might become. She had been isolated for days—her wound from the Ash Child slow to heal, her sleep haunted by visions of glass and green fire. The others watched her through reinforced glass, unsure if they were guarding her… or themselves.

Kaia paced the command room, voice hoarse from arguing with Ryn and Lena. “We can’t just lock her away. If she’s the key, we need answers—not a scapegoat.”

Ryn shook his head, exhaustion pulling at his features. “You saw the data. The Yggdrasil cylinder, Epsilon-7… She’s not just a target. She’s a catalyst. If the entity gets to her—”

Lena broke in, voice trembling. “Or if she loses control. The resonance patterns in her blood, the way the crystals responded. She’s changing, Kaia. And the city feels it.”

Kora sat in her cell, staring at her own trembling hands. Each night, the dreams grew stronger—a woman’s voice calling through a storm of crystal, a promise of understanding and power. The city’s neural static pressed in like a tide, and in its depths, Kora heard a new thread: an invitation, a summons.

On the third night, the visions became unbearable. In her mind’s eye, she saw a land of glass spires and endless storms—Fulminite Deeps, the city’s forbidden edge. At the center: a woman wreathed in light and crystal, her eyes echoing Kora’s own. The Crystal Witch.

Kaia found her the next morning, eyes wild but clear. “It’s calling me,” Kora said. “She’s calling me. If we want answers, I have to go.”

Felix, grim-faced but loyal, volunteered to join them. “If you’re going into the storm, you’re not going alone.”

The journey to the Fulminite Deeps was a trial by chaos. Thunderstorms battered their crawler, electromagnetic interference scrambled their comms, and the ground itself pulsed with veins of living glass. Kora guided them, drawn by an instinct she didn’t understand—a resonance in her bones.

At the threshold of the glass wastes, they abandoned the crawler and pressed on foot. The air shimmered with energy, every breath a test of will. Felix muttered curses under his breath; Kaia kept her eyes on Kora, searching for any sign of possession.

They found her deep within a field of jagged crystal—Solara, the Crystal Witch, her body half-fused with the luminous glass, her voice echoing in both mind and air.

*“Welcome, child of the coil,”* Solara intoned, her gaze locking onto Kora. *“I have watched your world fracture and sing. You are the first in generations to hear the true resonance.”*

Kaia stepped forward, weapon lowered but ready. “What are you? What do you want with her?”

Solara’s laughter was like wind through glass. *“I am what your world made me. Primus, once. Now, a bridge between storm and silence. The Cascade is not only destruction—it is potential. But only those who learn to harmonize can survive its song.”*

Kora felt the resonance within her pulse, the Serpent’s Coil awakening in response to Solara’s presence. She stepped closer, fear giving way to aching hope. “Can you help me control this? Or am I doomed to be a weapon?”

Solara raised a hand, crystalline light flowing from her palm into Kora’s heart. *“I can teach you to listen. To shape the song, not be shaped by it. But the price is clarity. Once you hear the world as it truly is, you cannot go back.”*

The lesson was agony and revelation—a torrent of memory, pain, and understanding. Kora saw the birth of the Cascade, the Primus experiments, the collapse of Solara’s humanity, and the countless ways the entity had twisted hope into hunger.

When the vision faded, Kora was kneeling, breathless but unbroken. The resonance within her was no longer chaotic—it thrummed with purpose, a harmony she could grasp but not yet command.

Solara knelt beside her, voice gentle. *“You are not a curse, Kora. You are a conductor. You can shield, heal, and—if you choose—change the song of this world. But you must choose.”*

Kaia helped Kora to her feet, awe and fear mingling in her eyes. Felix kept watch, silent but unwavering.

Solara’s form began to fade, the storm claiming her once more. *“Return to your enclave. The entity will sense your awakening and test your harmony. But remember: you are not alone. The world itself yearns for a new song.”*

They returned through the storm, Kora changed at the core. The path ahead was more dangerous than ever, but for the first time, she felt hope—not just for herself, but for all who still resisted the silence.
