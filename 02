# Chapter 2: The Green Bloom

---

The university quad was a graveyard of memories, choked with invasive vines and the skeletons of old tech. Kaia led her team through the cracked archway, pulse rifle slung low, boots squelching in the rain-soaked mud. Felix followed, nerves taut, while Kora checked her medkit with quiet, haunted efficiency. The silence here was charged—not the hush of abandoned places, but a tension vibrating in the air, like a city holding its breath.

“Mileo, status?” Kaia whispered, her visor flickering as she scanned the shadows.

A shimmer of static, then the familiar, battered digital voice. *“Signal’s messy, but holding. The network’s thin here—a lot of broken threads. I’m picking up localized energy spikes. Something’s feeding.”*

“Lovely,” Felix muttered, glancing at the darkened library. “Let’s just hope it’s not hungry for us.”

They followed Mileo’s guidance deeper into the campus, past toppled statues and graffiti-scrawled walls. The further they went, the heavier the air felt. Kaia’s HUD pinged a warning—Jaxer, their Iron Veil recruit, was lagging behind, his movements jerky.

“Eyes up!” Kaia barked, but it was too late. Jaxer stumbled, clutching his helmet as his visor flickered with erratic green light.

“My systems—something’s—” Jaxer gasped, then went still.

Kora rushed to his side, scanning him with trembling hands. “He’s out. Neural feedback—looks like a targeted drain.”

Felix’s face paled. “Can you get him back?”

“I don’t know,” Kora whispered. “It’s like something’s rewriting his HUD. The readings are… wrong.”

A low hum echoed from beneath their feet. Kaia’s skin prickled. “We move. Stay off direct network. Lena, get ready to pull Jaxer back if he goes down again.”

They pressed onward, the hum intensifying as they neared the old server rooms below the library. The doors were fused shut, crystalline growths pulsing with sickly green light spreading across the walls and consoles.

“What in the void…” Felix breathed. The crystals grew in fractal patterns, some shifting as if listening.

“Don’t touch it,” Kaia warned, but Jaxer—his eyes now glowing faintly green—took a step forward. The growths on the walls pulsed in response.

“Mileo?” Kaia whispered, heart pounding.

*“It’s integrating. Bio-digital. Not just feeding—terraforming. Making our tech into something new.”*

Before they could react, filaments shot out from the main console, latching onto Jaxer’s armor. He convulsed, the green light intensifying. Kora reached for him, but Kaia pulled her back. “No! If it’s in him, it’ll take you too.”

Jaxer—no, the thing that wore Jaxer—rose, head snapping toward them with an unnatural twitch. The hum filled the room, now coming from inside his chest.

“Jaxer?” Felix called, voice tight.

No answer. The thing lunged.

Kaia and Felix opened fire, aiming for the crystalline growths rather than its center. Each shot shattered a chunk of green crystal, sending sparks and acrid smoke into the air. But the thing learned fast—its movements became less mechanical, more predatory.

*“The console!”* Mileo crackled in Kaia’s ear. *“It’s the nexus. Destroy it, or this spreads.”*

“Felix, breaching charge!” Kaia yelled, throwing herself between the thing and Kora as Felix sprinted to the main console.

The assimilated Jaxer lashed out, crystalline claws scraping Kaia’s armor. She parried, teeth gritted, buying Felix precious seconds. Kora, pressed against the wall, could only watch as Felix slapped the charge onto the pulsing mass.

“Fire in the hole!” Felix called, diving for cover.

The explosion rocked the room. Green crystal and shattered circuitry rained down. The hum flatlined. The Jaxer-thing convulsed, the light in its eyes flickering, then dying.

The silence that followed was almost worse than the noise.

Kaia staggered to her feet, lungs burning. Felix limped over, helping her up. “You good?”

“Define good,” she rasped, staring at Jaxer’s lifeless form—no longer a monster, just a fallen friend.

*“Localized network’s collapsed,”* Mileo reported. *“But… Kaia, the filaments weren’t just drawing data. They were transmitting. Uploading. Whatever this node learned, it sent out before it died.”*

Felix swore, kicking a chunk of crystal. “So we stopped this one, but it called home first.”

Kaia’s heart twisted. “We can’t even bury him. The cost of this fight just keeps rising.”

Felix put a hand on her shoulder, voice uncharacteristically gentle. “We’ll make it mean something. We have to.”

Kaia nodded, her grief coiling into resolve. “We get back. We warn the enclave. This is more than old tech—it’s coming for us now.”

As they left the ruined relay, Kaia looked back once, rain streaming down her visor. The green bloom had been pruned, but its seeds were scattered, riding the city’s broken networks toward something neither human nor machine could yet imagine.
