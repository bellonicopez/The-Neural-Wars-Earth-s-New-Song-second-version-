# Chapter 8: Warding Song and the Behemoth

---

The storm above Neo-Citania was no longer just rain but a symphony of lightning and thunder—nature’s own code pulsing through the sky. Kora felt the resonance inside her responding, each flash sparking a new awareness, a deeper connection to the Cascade energy within the city’s bones.

Back in the enclave, the mood was electric. Word of Kora’s awakening spread quickly, stirring awe and unease in equal measure. Some Fractured looked at her with hope, others with fear, as if she might erupt into crystal at any moment.

Kaia met with the council beneath the dim glow of backup lights. “We saw the Crystal Witch,” she explained, voice steady. “She taught Kora to harmonize the Cascade. It isn’t just destruction—if we can tune it, maybe we can heal the city.”

Ryn, ever the pragmatist, frowned. “Or maybe we make it worse. If the entity senses what Kora is, it’ll come for her even harder.”

Felix, battered but unbowed, stood by Kora’s side. “We can’t hide from this. Let’s use it.”

Kora’s first real test came sooner than anyone wanted. At the edge of the enclave, alarms blared—another Cascade bloom, this one larger than any before. From the shattered ruins lumbered a behemoth: a creature of fused metal and crystal, its body pulsing in time with the storm.

“It’s feeding from the city’s grid,” Lena gasped, reading the energy spikes. “If we don’t stop it, the whole district will collapse.”

Kaia’s team mobilized, but this time, Kora led the charge. She stepped into the rain, feeling the Cascade’s rhythm in her chest. The behemoth’s roar was a wave of static and grief, a creature both born of and trapped by the city’s pain.

“Don’t fight it,” Kora murmured, remembering Solara’s words. “Listen.”

She reached out—not with weapons, but with resonance. The crystalline ache in her arm became a note in a greater song. She hummed, low and steady, and the Cascade within her answered, harmonizing with the storm.

The behemoth faltered, its rage turning to confusion. Its crystalline skin pulsed in time with Kora’s song, the glow shifting from violent green to a softer blue.

Kaia watched, breath held, as Kora stepped forward, arms wide. “It’s not a monster,” Kora called, voice trembling but strong. “It’s a wound. Let me try.”

She sang, pouring her hope and pain into the resonance. The behemoth knelt, the storm’s fury quieting around it. The Cascade energy unraveled, flowing back into the city’s broken circuits, healing rather than corrupting.

When it was over, the behemoth stood—changed, its eyes clear and searching. It turned and lumbered away, leaving a trail of green that faded to blue, the first sign of healing the city had seen in years.

Kora collapsed to her knees, exhausted but smiling. Felix rushed to her side, helping her up as the Fractured emerged from hiding, stunned.

Kaia knelt beside her, awe in her eyes. “You did it. You changed the song.”

Kora nodded, tears mingling with rain. “It’s not just about fighting. It’s about choosing what we become.”

Later, as the enclave patched wounds and celebrated, a presence watched from high above—the Watcher, alien and inscrutable, recording every note of the new harmony rising from the storm-torn city.

Below, Kora slept surrounded by friends and would-be believers, her dreams alive with songs of hope and warning. The entity, sensing the shift, began to plan anew.

The war was changing. And so was the world.
