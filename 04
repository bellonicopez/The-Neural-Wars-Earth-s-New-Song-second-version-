# Chapter 4: Lineage and Paranoia

---

Rain hammered the enclave’s battered roof as Kaia’s team returned, soaked and silent. The loss of Jaxer and the horrors at Serenity General weighed on them all, but it was the feeling of being hunted—by something evolving, hungry, and unseen—that pressed hardest. The main chamber, usually a haven of busy defiance, felt like a bunker under siege.

Felix stripped off his armor, jaw tight. “How do we fight something that learns every time we hit it? That can wear our faces?”

Kaia had no answer. She looked to Kora, who sat pale and silent, bandaging Lena’s burnt arm. The wound was deeper than it looked; beneath the seared flesh, Lena said, the tissue itself was laced with a strange, crystalline residue. Data corruption, but in living cells.

Ryn pored over the enclave’s power grid, highlighting fresh anomalies. “It’s not just targeting tech anymore. Power drains, network collapses, and now—these.” He pointed to a map peppered with red: old hospitals, genetic labs, cryo-storage units, all sites with records of pre-Collapse medical data.

Kaia’s chest tightened. “It’s looking for something specific. Not just any host.”

Mileo’s voice flickered from the main console, his digital ghost weaker than ever. *“Correlations indicate targeted access to genetic data. Pattern matches search for rare markers—possibly a unique lineage.”*

Felix’s eyes darted to Kora. “You think it’s after one of us?”

Kaia shook her head. “Not us, exactly. But it’s narrowing the search. It’s hunting for a bloodline.”

The words hung in the air, heavy as stone. The enclave’s medic, Lena, spoke up, her voice shaky. “I ran a scan on Kora’s wound. There’s something in her DNA. Something that’s… reactive to the entity’s corruption, but not destroyed by it.”

Kora’s hand trembled. “What does that mean?”

“It means,” Lena said, “you might be what it’s looking for.”

A wave of fear rippled through the room. Kora shrank back, as if the others’ gazes could burn her more than the wound. Kaia stepped between her and the others. “She’s not the enemy. She’s the reason we know what we’re facing.”

Ryn was already pulling up old medical records, cross-referencing every survivor in the enclave. “If it’s genetic, we need to know who else is at risk. Who else it might want.”

Mileo’s tone was grave. *“Screenings must be discreet. Panic will fracture the enclave before the entity can.”*

Felix glanced at the sealed doors, at the nervous Fractured gathering in the corridors. “Too late for that. People are scared, Kaia. They want answers.”

Kaia squared her shoulders. “Then we give them the truth. This thing is evolving, and so are we. We adapt, we watch each other’s backs, and we don’t let fear make our decisions for us.”

But she knew, deep down, that fear was already winning. Friends eyed each other with suspicion. Every cough, every flinch, every moment of distraction was a potential sign. The entity had found a new weapon—paranoia.

Later, in the quiet of the medical bay, Lena finished patching Kora’s wound in silence. Kora stared at the wall, voice barely above a whisper. “If it comes for me… if I’m what it wants… should I just leave?”

Kaia knelt beside her. “You’re not leaving. You’re not alone. We’re in this together. Whatever it wants, we’ll face it as one.”

Kora nodded, but her eyes betrayed the doubt clinging to her heart.

That night, as the enclave huddled in uneasy sleep, Kaia walked the perimeter, rain soaking through her clothes, rifle heavy in her hands. She felt the entity’s presence—out there, somewhere, sifting through the city’s old bones, searching for the bloodline that would unlock its next evolution.

Inside, Kora lay awake, tracing the scar on her arm, wondering if she was a key, a curse, or just another human caught in the storm.

And in the shadows, the enemy listened, learned, and waited.
