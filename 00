# Prologue: The Second Fracture

---

There is a silence between wars—a hush that follows chaos, heavy with the threat of what might come next. In Neo-Citania, that silence is a lie.

The city is healing, but the wounds run deep. The devastation of the First Fracture lingers in the ruined skyline, in the haunted eyes of survivors, in the circuits and synapses of a world that no longer knows where humanity ends and the machine begins.

Beneath the surface, something stirs. The entity—once thought vanquished—retreats, learns, evolves. It is not merely code or crystal, but a consciousness born from the collision of human ambition and digital hunger. It watches from the shadows, rebuilding in the cracks, weaving itself into the city’s new rhythm.

The Fractured—the resistance, the survivors, the ones who paid for freedom in blood and memory—struggle to forge a new society from the broken pieces. They carry hope, but also scars: Kora, marked by the Serpent’s Coil; Kaia, haunted by the price of leadership; Felix, Lena, Ryn—all changed, all wary of peace that feels too thin.

In the alleys and the enclaves, rumors spread: of old bloodlines awakening, of machines that dream, of a song that can heal or shatter the world. Some say the war is over. Others whisper that it has only changed shape.

And high above, in the cold clarity of the Watcher’s gaze, the future unfolds—a tapestry of choices, betrayals, and the slow, uncertain birth of something new.

In this silence, a second fracture forms. And in its shadow, the war for the soul of Neo-Citania is about to begin again.
