# Chapter 3: The Warden of Serenity

---

Serenity General Hospital loomed in the gloom, a relic of an age when hope had a place in medicine. Its once-white facade was streaked with brown and grey, windows blind and broken, the main entrance barricaded by rusted metal and a tangle of invasive vines. Kaia’s team—Felix, Kora, and Lena—slipped through the rain-soaked streets, adrenaline thrumming under their skin.

“This is where the seed-data pointed?” Felix asked, his voice low, pulse rifle ready.

Kaia nodded, scanning the perimeter. “Mileo tracked the transmission here. The entity’s after something in the old records—genetic data, maybe. We move fast. In and out.”

Lena’s hands trembled as she checked her medical kit. “Hospitals give me the creeps now. The things we’ve seen…”

Kaia shot her a look that was half grim humor, half apology. “It’s worse if we let whatever’s in there spread.”

Inside, the hospital was colder than the rain outside—a chill that seeped into bone and thought. Emergency lights flickered, painting the halls with sickly green. The air reeked of antiseptic, rot, and something metallic. Every footstep echoed, too loud.

Mileo’s voice came through Kaia’s HUD, fractured by static. *“The interference is strong. It’s not just digital—there’s a biological component. The entity’s using the hospital’s residual data and genetic samples to… evolve.”*

They moved through abandoned wards, stepping over toppled beds and shattered glass. In the old pathology lab, they found the source—a crystalline mass pulsing with green light, tendrils reaching for racks of specimen jars.

“It’s feeding on the samples,” Lena whispered, horror in her voice. “It’s… learning.”

Kaia fired a burst at the base of the growth, shattering crystal and glass. The mass shrieked—a sound that was neither machine nor human—and sprouted a new limb, tipped with crystalline claws.

Felix laid down covering fire as Lena scrambled to find an exit. “We can’t fight this thing head-on,” he shouted. “It’s adapting too fast!”

*“It’s not just building a body,”* Mileo warned. *“It’s searching for something—specific genetic markers. It’s cross-referencing patient records, trying to find compatibility.”*

Kora’s face went pale. “You mean it’s looking for a host?”

Kaia nodded grimly. “Not just any host. A perfect one.”

They retreated through a narrow service corridor, the walls pulsing with the same unnatural hum. At the far end, a reinforced door marked “Cryogenics” stood ajar. They slipped inside, finding rows of stasis pods and a central chamber where the entity’s influence was strongest.

From the shadows, figures emerged—pale, naked, their eyes blank. Drones, once patients, now puppets of the crystalline network.

Felix fired, shattering one drone into a spray of glass and inert flesh. “It’s building an army,” he muttered, voice tight.

“We need to disrupt the nexus,” Kaia said, eyeing the central spire. “Felix, charges. Kora, cover Lena.”

As they set the explosives, the drones closed in. Kaia fought back-to-back with Felix, every shot buying precious seconds. Lena worked frantically to reroute power from the stasis grid, trying to overload the entity’s core.

Suddenly, a brilliant white light erupted from one of the pods. The drones froze. The green glow in the spire flickered and dimmed.

A figure stepped from the pod—tall, clad in a silvery suit, eyes cold and ancient. The drones recoiled as the newcomer raised a hand, dissolving the nearest with a beam of pure white energy.

Kaia stared, stunned. “Who—what are you?”

The figure’s voice was melodic, precise, echoing in the chamber. “I am the Warden. This facility—and its subjects—are under my protection.”

The entity’s spire pulsed, then shuddered as the Warden advanced, dissolving drones and crystal alike. The battle was one-sided; the entity’s constructs could not withstand the Warden’s touch.

When the last drone fell, the Warden turned to Kaia’s team, eyes like shards of ice. “The contamination must be purged. All unauthorized biological and technological signatures—including yours—must be removed.”

Felix’s grip tightened on his rifle. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”

The Warden’s hand began to glow, the promise of annihilation in its light.

*“Kaia,”* Mileo whispered, “run.”

But Kaia stood her ground. “We’re not your enemy. The entity—”

“The protocol is absolute,” the Warden intoned. “You have sixty seconds.”

As the hospital’s alarms wailed and the temperature plummeted, Kaia made her choice. “Move! Now!”

They fled, the Warden’s voice echoing after them, a blend of machine logic and something older, colder.

*Containment is absolute. The cycle continues.*

They escaped into the rain, hearts pounding. Behind them, Serenity General was locked down, its secrets sealed again. But a fragment of what they’d seen clung to Kaia’s mind:

A guardian older than the city, bound to protocols written in the bones of the Old World. An entity evolving to hunt them by their very blood.

And a war that was only beginning to reveal its true stakes.
