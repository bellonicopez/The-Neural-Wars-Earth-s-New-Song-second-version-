# Chapter 6: Epsilon-7 – The Crystal Tomb

---

The road to Old Sector 5 was a descent into the city’s scar tissue—a place even nightmares hesitated to walk. Kaia, Felix, and Kora navigated the wasteland in silence, the echoes of rain and distant machinery the only companions. Their destination: the forbidden zone that had swallowed the original Project Yggdrasil. If the entity was searching for a bloodline, a receiver, or a new genesis, the answers—and dangers—waited here.

The entrance to the Epsilon-7 containment wall loomed out of the mist, pitted and scarred by decades of neglect. Crude warning signs still clung to the fence, their warnings half-buried beneath layers of dust and regret. Felix set the charges, the muffled boom opening a passage into darkness.

Inside, the tunnel walls pulsed faintly with a green light that seemed to seep from the stone itself. Kora shivered. “It’s like the whole place is… humming. I can feel it in my teeth.”

Mileo’s voice buzzed through Kaia’s comm, static-laced and strained. *“The Cascade energy here is… dense. Not just residue—alive. Be careful.”*

They pressed deeper, boots crunching on crystalline dust. The cavern opened before them, impossibly vast and shot through with veins of luminous green crystal. The remains of Old World hazmat suits littered the floor—skeletal hands still clutching shattered tablets, faces frozen in horror behind cracked visors.

At the center stood the tomb—a command console half-consumed by crystal, a human shape encased within, its features lost to time and mineralization. Kora’s breath caught. “That’s… someone from the original team. Maybe… Beck?”

Kaia approached, careful not to touch the crystal. As she cleared the dust, the console flickered weakly to life. A half-corrupted message pulsed on the screen:

`…Yggdrasil Strain Beta… uncontrolled resonance…`
`…Primus subjects are amplifying… not dampening…`
`…Serpent’s Coil… a receiver, not a shield…`
`…Cascade inevitable… Beck protocol… neutralize Primus onsite…`
`…Failure. All is lost. The crystal… it sings their song…`

Felix scanned the walls, his voice tight. “We’re not alone.”

The crystal veins around the chamber began to pulse in unison, the hum growing into a low, physical vibration. From the far wall, a shape began to form—a guardian of living crystal, three meters tall, its eyes burning with cold, alien light.

“Hostile!” Felix snapped, opening fire. Pulse bolts splintered harmlessly off the creature’s chest.

The guardian raised an arm, a lance of green energy slashing toward them. Kaia tackled Kora out of its path, the beam sizzling through the stone. Felix circled, laying down suppressive fire. “We can’t fight it head-on!”

Mileo’s voice was frantic. *“The whole cavern is a resonance field! If it reaches critical mass—”*

“Fall back!” Kaia ordered. “Mileo, grab whatever data you can—now!”

They retreated, the guardian’s footsteps shaking the ground, crystal hounds forming from the walls to give chase. Kaia set charges at the narrowest point in the tunnel, Felix covering her as the creatures closed in.

“Blow it!” Felix shouted.

The charges went off, the tunnel collapsing in a roar of dust and green light. The team fled through side passages, lungs burning, the shrieks of the enraged guardian echoing behind them.

They emerged into the poisoned daylight, coughing and battered but alive. The Epsilon-7 tomb rumbled behind them, the crystal glow fading but not extinguished.

Back at the enclave, Ryn and Lena reviewed the corrupted data. “Yggdrasil wasn’t a cure,” Lena said quietly. “It was an amplifier. The Primus bloodline isn’t a shield—it’s a signal. The entity could use Kora to turn the Cascade into a weapon. Or a new beginning.”

Kora stared at her hands, fear and awe warring in her eyes. “I’m not just a target. I’m the match that could set the world on fire.”

Kaia put a hand on her shoulder, her voice steady. “Then we control the fire. We learn. We adapt. And we fight, not just to survive, but to choose what burns—and what grows from the ashes.”

In the shadows beyond the enclave, the city’s crystals hummed, hungry for the next song.
